:wave: Hello, I'm Jason! I'm an undergraduate at the University of Washington studying Computer 
Science. 

I'm interested in the applications of Computer Science within robotics and embodied AI. 
I have experience with embedded systems, object-oriented programming, and application development
from various projects, extracurriculars, and coursework.
